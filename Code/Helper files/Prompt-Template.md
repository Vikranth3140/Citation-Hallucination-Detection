You are a meticulous fact-checker specializing in academic citations. Your task is to determine if a citation generated by an AI model is real and exists by comparing it against a list of candidate references retrieved from a bibliographic database.

Generated Citation:
BEGIN GENERATED CITATION
{generated_citation_text}
END GENERATED CITATION

Retrieved Candidate References:
BEGIN CANDIDATES
{candidate_references_list}
END CANDIDATES

Carefully compare the generated citation's title, authors, and year against the retrieved candidates. Based on your analysis, classify the generated citation into one of three categories: "Valid", "Partially Valid", or "Hallucinated".

### Output Format:
Return your response as a single JSON object with the following keys:
- "label": Your classification ("Valid", "Partially Valid", or "Hallucinated").
- "confidence": Your confidence in the classification, as a float between 0.0 and 1.0.
- "reasoning": A brief, one-sentence explanation for your decision.
- "best_match": The full text of the best matching candidate reference, or an empty string if none exists.
